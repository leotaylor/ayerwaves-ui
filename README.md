# Ayerwaves Music Festival
## Since I am a good friend, I have agreed to help my friends that are moving their music festival to Nashville. They were in need of a new website, and it seemed fun to me. This is a Full Stack Web Development Project. I crated a SQL Database, linked it to a restful API that I created using C#/.NET, and then hosted the database and API on Azure. I then created a React.js app where I could make Axios calls to my API in order to retrieve the data.

# Features
- The Ayerwaves admin can quickly an easily add new artists and vendors to their site just by filling out the input fields provided on the admin page.
- This is a full CRUD app where artists and vendors can be edited and deleted.
- Auth used with JWT Tokens and Firbase User info.
- Admin has the option to add new Genres and Stages to the default list provided.
- A genre or stage name can be edited anytime, but can only be deleted if it is not being used.
